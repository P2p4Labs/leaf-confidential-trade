# Build Fix - Vercel Deployment Issue Resolved

## Issue Description

Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'lovable-tagger' imported from /vercel/path0/vite.config.ts
```

## Root Cause

The `vite.config.ts` file still contained a reference to the `lovable-tagger` package that was removed from `package.json` during the refactoring process.

## Solution Applied

1. **Removed lovable-tagger import** from `vite.config.ts`
2. **Simplified vite configuration** to remove development-only component tagging
3. **Cleaned up plugin configuration** to only include necessary React plugin

## Changes Made

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
import { componentTagger } from "lovable-tagger";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  plugins: [react(), mode === "development" && componentTagger()].filter(Boolean),
  // ...
}));
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  // ...
});
```

## Verification

- ✅ No lovable-tagger references in any configuration files
- ✅ No lovable dependencies in package.json
- ✅ Clean vite.config.ts without development-only features
- ✅ Build should now work on Vercel

## Deployment Status

The fix has been committed and pushed to the repository. Vercel should now be able to build the project successfully.
